# <p align="center">My little ansible</p>
  
MyLittleAnsible is a Python command-line program designed to configure remote hosts using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. It allows you to automate system configuration tasks on remote hosts, leveraging a declarative approach to infrastructure setup. In this exemple i's for two Virtual machines.


### Execution of Todos

MyLittleAnsible executes tasks defined in a YAML file (todos.yml). Tasks include managing packages, copying files, templating configurations, and administering systemd services.

### SSH Authentication

MyLittleAnsible supports three methods of SSH authentication:

- Default SSH configuration
- Username/password authentication
- Private key authentication

### Inventory Management

Define the hosts to configure in an inventory file (inventory.yml). Each host includes SSH connection details such as address and port.

### Execution Modules

- `copy`: Copy files or directories to remote hosts.
- `template`: Render Jinja2 templates on remote hosts.
- `service`: Manage systemd services on remote hosts.
- `sysctl`: Modify kernel parameters on remote hosts.
- `apt`: Manage APT packages on remote hosts.
- `command`: Execute arbitrary shell commands on remote hosts.
